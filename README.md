#What difference between Abstraction and Polymorphism?
Abstraction and polymorphism are both object-oriented programming concepts. Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and showing only the essential features of the class. This allows the programmer to focus on the essentials of the class and not get distracted by the details of the implementation.

Polymorphism, on the other hand, is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In PHP, this is typically achieved through inheritance, where a child class can inherit the methods and properties of a parent class, but can also override those methods to provide its own implementation. This allows for a more flexible and reusable code base.

In summary, abstraction focuses on the essential features of a class, while polymorphism allows for flexibility and code reuse through inheritance and method overriding.
